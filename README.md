## Acknowledgments
ðŸ“š The main idea of this project was inspired by a Python course. I implemented additional features like the UI, password generation, and data saving myself. This project helped me improve my Python and Tkinter skills. Feel free to customize it!

*Note:* I followed the guidelines and concepts from the course, but most of the implementation is my own.

**Happy coding!** ðŸš€
